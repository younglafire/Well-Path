<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Well Path is a health-focused goal tracking application designed to help users set meaningful goals, monitor their progress, and connect with others for motivation. Built as my CS50W Final Project, this application demonstrates full-stack web development capabilities with a focus on clean architecture, user experience, and social interaction.

**The Philosophy Behind Well Path:**

The idea is simple but powerful: achieving health goals becomes easier when you can track your progress and share your journey with others. Whether it's exercise milestones, nutrition targets, or fitness achievements, Well Path provides the tools to stay accountable and motivated.

**My Role & Approach:**

- **Backend & Core Features**: I implemented all functionality, database models, and business logic from scratch
- **Frontend/UI**: Leveraged AI tools to generate initial components and layouts, then debugged and customized them to integrate seamlessly with my backend
- **Focus**: Designed with health goals in mind, but the architecture is flexible enough to extend to other goal categories

This project showcases my ability to:
- Design and implement full-stack web applications
- Work with modern web frameworks and databases
- Debug and integrate AI-generated code with custom backend logic
- Build scalable, deployment-ready applications
- Implement both individual and social features
